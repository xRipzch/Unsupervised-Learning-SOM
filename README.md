## Introduction
This project explores **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**, a type of unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering and dimensionality reduction. SOMs are particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space.

## What is a Self-Organizing Map?
A **Self-Organizing Map** is a type of artificial neural network that uses competitive learning to map high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional grid. Unlike traditional neural networks, SOMs do not require labeled data and are trained to preserve the topological structure of the input data.

Key features:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: No labeled data required.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Projects high-dimensional data into a 2D or 3D space.
- **Topology Preservation**: Maintains the relationships between data points.

## Applications of SOM
- **Data Visualization**: Reducing high-dimensional data for easier interpretation.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers in datasets.
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying important features in datasets.
- **Market Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.

## How SOM Works
1. **Initialization**: A grid of neurons is initialized with random weights.
2. **Input Data**: High-dimensional data is fed into the SOM.
3. **Best Matching Unit (BMU)**: For each input, the neuron with the closest weight vector is identified.
4. **Weight Update**: The BMU and its neighbors adjust their weights to better match the input.
5. **Repeat**: Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.
